## Final Assessment
The American Dream Taxes Hub provides a solid foundation for tax practice management with its core features implemented. However, several improvements are needed to enhance usability, efficiency, and user experience. The most critical areas requiring attention are session management, user identification display, and advanced task management features. The application would benefit significantly from implementing the recommended improvements, particularly in the high-priority category.

The application shows promise but needs refinement to become a fully-featured practice management tool. The clean interface and basic functionality provide a good starting point for these improvements.
