## Final Assessment
The American Dream Taxes Hub provides a solid foundation but needs significant restructuring to implement a more efficient, unified approach to project and task management. The most critical change needed is consolidating projects and tasks into a single, well-organized view with clear sections and hierarchies. This change, along with improved task details and dependencies visualization, will significantly enhance user productivity and workflow efficiency.

The application shows promise with its tax-practice specific features, but the current separation of projects and tasks creates unnecessary complexity. By implementing a unified view with proper section-based organization, the system will better serve its users while maintaining its specialized functionality.

### Next Steps
1. Begin unified view implementation
2. Update template system
3. Enhance task management
4. Add proper filtering and grouping
5. Improve client integration
