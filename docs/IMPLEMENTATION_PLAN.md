## Adapting Existing Modules

The following outlines how the existing planned modules align with the practice management structure:

*   **Client Onboarding**: This aligns with the **Client Management** module, focusing on the initial stages of client interaction.
*   **Bookkeeping**: This functionality would be a part of the **Project and Task Management** module, representing a type of project or task. Integration with accounting software (under **Integration Hub**) is crucial here.
*   **Payroll**: Similar to Bookkeeping, Payroll processing can be managed within the **Project and Task Management** module. Integration with payroll services (under **Integration Hub**) is key.
*   **Tax Preparation**: This complex module can be considered a major project type within **Project and Task Management**. It will heavily utilize **Document Management** and potentially integrate with tax preparation software (under **Integration Hub**).
*   **Financial Reporting & Review**: This directly corresponds to the **Reporting and Analytics** module.
*   **Communication & Client Management**: This aligns with the **Client Management** module, specifically the communication aspects.
*   **Quality Control & Security**: These considerations should be implemented across all modules but can be managed under **User Management and Settings** for access control and potentially within **Project and Task Management** for review workflows.
