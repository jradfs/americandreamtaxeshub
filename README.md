# American Dream Financial Services - Practice Management Tool

**Vision**: Build a robust, scalable, AI-driven practice management tool that supports:
- **Accounting & Bookkeeping** (QuickBooks)
- **Tax Preparation** tasks & deadlines (TaxSlayer)
- **Client Management** & contact info
- **Project & Task Management**
- **Team Collaboration & Roles**

**Primary Objectives**:
- **Systematize** processes for consistent workflows.
- **Enable automation** (e.g., reminders, AI analysis).
- **Scale** to thousands of clients and hundreds of staff members.
- **Integrate** with existing solutions (Google Workspace, Gmail, QuickBooks, TaxSlayer).

## Key Highlights

1. **Database Migrations & Schema**  
   - All IDs converted to UUID for consistent referencing & horizontal scaling.
   - JSON fields normalized for better structure (e.g., `activity_log_entries`, `checklist_items`).
   - Timestamps (`created_at`, `updated_at`) are standardized.

2. **Next Steps**:
   - Review and refine application code (front-end & back-end).
   - Confirm references to numeric IDs are fully replaced with UUID strings.
   - Expand AI-driven features for task automation, scheduling, and data analysis.
