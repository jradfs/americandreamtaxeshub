## Implementation Priorities

### 1. Database Security (Immediate Priority)
- Set up Row Level Security (RLS)
  ```sql
  -- Policies needed:
  -- 1. View tasks for project members
  -- 2. Create tasks in projects
  -- 3. Update assigned tasks
  -- 4. Delete own tasks
  ```
- Implement proper user role management
- Add necessary database indexes

### 2. Task Management Core Features
- Task Creation and Updates
  - Form validation
  - File attachments
  - Task templates
- Assignment System
  - User selection
  - Email notifications
  - Role-based assignments
- Status Management
  - Status transitions
  - Progress tracking
  - Activity logging

### 3. User Interface Improvements
- Task filtering and search
- Sort tasks by different criteria
- Batch operations
- Task dependencies
- Timeline view

## Next Steps
1. Implement database security policies
2. Add task deletion functionality
3. Implement task status transitions
4. Add task activity logging
5. Improve real-time updates
6. Add bulk operations support

## Development Considerations
- Ensure proper error handling

- Implement optimistic updates
- Add proper TypeScript types
- Maintain consistent state management
- Follow established patterns

## Documentation Needs
1. Update API documentation
2. Add security policy documentation
3. Document task workflows
4. Add user guides

## Future Enhancements
