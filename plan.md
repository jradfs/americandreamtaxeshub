# Project and Task Management Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to implement project and task management functionality for the application, excluding automated testing. Manual testing will be conducted post-implementation.

## Steps

### 1. Database Updates
- Ensure all required schema updates have been made.
- Any future SQL commands, schema changes, or database operations are performed exclusively via the Supabase server MCP tool.

### 2. API Development
- Resolve module resolution and import issues. **(Skipped for now - unable to resolve)**
- Correctly integrate Supabase client imports.
- Confirm API functions return expected data without automated tests; use console logs or a simple Node.js script to validate. **(Skipped for now)**

### 3. Frontend Integration
- Integrate the API with UI components.
- Ensure that UI elements display data accurately.

### 4. Manual Testing
- No `npx`, Playwright, or automated tests will be used.
- Manually run `npm run dev` to verify:
  - API calls return correct data.
  - UI displays expected projects and tasks.
- Validate that changes align with the intended workflow and design reference. **(Skipped for now)**

### 5. Deployment
- After verifying locally, build and deploy.
- Perform another round of manual testing in the deployed environment. **(Skipped for now)**

### 6. Fix Module Resolution Issues
    *   Module Configuration
        *   Ensure package.json includes "type": "module" for ES module syntax.
        *   All file imports should explicitly include extensions like .js or .mjs for Node.js to resolve paths correctly. **(Skipped for now - unable to resolve)**
    *   File Extensions
        *   Verify that all import paths explicitly define file extensions. **(Skipped for now - unable to resolve)**
    *   Ensure node_modules is Up-to-Date
        *   Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are installed correctly. **(Skipped for now - unable to resolve)**
### 7. Resolve API Module Issues
    *   Update API Functions
        *   Use correct imports from supabase client.
        *   Replace any incorrect imports with: `import { getSupabase } from './supabase/client.js';` **(Skipped for now - unable to resolve)**
    *   Fix Absolute Paths
        *   Add paths in tsconfig.json:
            ```json
            {
              "compilerOptions": {
                "baseUrl": ".",
                "paths": {
                  "*": ["src/*"]
                }
              }
            }
            ```
        *   Update API imports to: `import { fetchProjectsWithTasks } from 'lib/api';` **(Skipped for now - unable to resolve)**
### 8. Manual Testing for API
    *   Skip Test Automation
        *   Testing with tools like Playwright or npx will not be used.
        *   Manual testing will be conducted post-implementation.
    *   Validate API Integration
        *   Use a basic Node.js script or console logs to ensure API functions are working. **(Skipped for now)**
### 9. Frontend Component Integration
    *   Implement Component Logic
        *   Use the API functions in components like ProjectList and TaskList.
    *   Start the Application
        *   Run the development server to see the changes in the UI: `npm run dev` **(Skipped for now)**
    *   Manual Validation
        *   Verify the following manually:
            *   Projects are displayed correctly.
            *   Tasks are linked to projects.
            *   Templates are applied correctly. **(Skipped for now)**
### 10. Deployment
    *   Prepare the application for production.
    *   Deploy to a hosting platform.
    *   Perform manual end-to-end testing on the live application. **(Skipped for now)**
